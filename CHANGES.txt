Changes
=======

0.4 (2012-02-14)
----------------

- Peppercorn will no longer run under Python 2.4.  2.5 or better is required.

- Python 3.2 compatibility.

- Moved to GitHub.

- Pylons project docs theme.

- Added tox configuration.

0.3 (2010-09-02)
----------------

- 0.2 was a brownbag release; a case was not handled where ``rename``
  operation types may not have children.  This release fixes that.

0.2 (2010-09-02)
----------------

- New operation type: ``rename``.  ``rename`` begins a special mode.
  The value of the first subsequent data element in the stream will be
  used within it's parent sequence or mapping; any remaining data
  elements until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker are ignored.
  This is mostly in support of radio buttons.  See the ``rename`` docs
  within `http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn
  <http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn>`_ for more information.

0.1 (2010-03-23)
----------------

- Initial release.
