Changes
=======

0.2 (2010-09-02)
----------------

- New operation type: ``rename``.  ``rename`` begins a special mode.
  The value of the first subsequent data element in the stream will be
  used within it's parent sequence or mapping; any remaining data
  elements until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker are ignored.
  This is mostly in support of radio buttons.  See the ``rename`` docs
  within `http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn
  <http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn>`_ for more information.

0.1 (2010-03-23)
